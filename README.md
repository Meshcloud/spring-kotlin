# Kotlin vs. Java implementation of a Spring Boot 1.5 application

This project is showing the advantages you can get, when switching from a Java to a Kotlin implementation.
As Spring Boot is a very popular framework in the Java world and Meshcloud is using it, this example is based on a Spring Boot 1.5 application.
It can also be used as a reference for implementing or converting your own Spring Boot 1.5 application to Kotlin.

## Run the sample app
You can simply clone this repository and execute the app with
`./gradlew bootRun`

## The different implementations
The master branch of this project contains the Kotlin implementation. In the java branch, you can find the according Java implementation.
There is also a mixed branch, which shows how you can use Java and Kotlin in parallel in your project.

## Slides
This example is used in a presentation, that emphasizes on the advantages of using Kotlin and can be found at [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/Meshcloud/spring-kotlin-example/master)
